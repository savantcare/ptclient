Insurance Coverage (through Aetna, Cigna and Cardinal Care):</strong></span></p>     <p>Savant Care is in the process of getting contracted with Aetna, Cigna and Cardinal Care (the Stanford Student Health branch of Managed Health Network).  This process should be completed by September 1<sup>st</sup>, 2014.  If you have any of the aforementioned insurances and are interested in utilizing their coverage for mental health treatment, it is very important that you find out exactly what mental health services your particular policy covers.  You should carefully read the plugin in your insurance coverage booklet that describes mental health services.  If you have questions about the coverage, call your plan administrator.  Our staff will provide you with assistance in receiving the benefits to which you are entitled; however <strong>you</strong> (not your insurance company) are responsible for full payment of your bill.  If your failure to comply with your insurance company\'s requirements regarding choice of providers, authorization or other issues results in the denial of claims, you will be responsible for paying in full.  If your coverage changes, it is your responsibility to notify your provider and to comply with your new policy.  Once Savant Care has all of the information about your insurance coverage, your psychiatrist will discuss what you can expect to accomplish with the benefits that are available and what will happen if they run out before you feel ready to end your treatment.  It is important to remember that you always have the right to pay for services out of pocket to avoid the potential issues described above (unless this is prohibited by your insurance contract). </p>     <p>You should be aware that your insurance company requires a clinical diagnosis and information about the services provided to you.  Sometimes, your physician must provide additional clinical information such as treatment plans or summaries, or copies of your entire Clinical Record.  In such situations, every effort will be made to release only the minimum information about you that is necessary for the purpose requested.  This information will become part of the insurance company\'s records.

All appropriate intake paperwork must be completed prior to your first appointment.  During the first session, the Savant Care provider will obtain a comprehensive history and determine whether our clinic can meet your treatment needs.  This session is also an opportunity for both you and the provider to assess your mutual compatibility for an ongoing treatment relationship.

Missed appointments prevent you from receiving required care and prevent the doctor from providing that care.  They also prevent another person from care during that time.  As a result, <strong>you will be financially responsible for the full session fee if you miss your appointment or fail to cancel your appointment within at least 3 business days of the appointment.</strong>  If an appointment must be missed for whatever reason, <strong>you have the option of rescheduling your appointment within the same week of the missed appointment depending on the doctor\'s availability; in this scenario, you will not be charged for a missed appointment.</strong> </p>     <p><strong>Disclosures:</strong> If you are a danger to yourself or others or if I suspect abuse towards a child, disabled adult or the elderly, I am ethically and legally required to report it to the appropriate authorities.</p>     <p><strong>Legal Issues:</strong> In order to safeguard the process of treatment, I do not testify in court nor participate in disability evaluations.

These laws protect the confidentiality of all communications between a patient and psychiatrist/psychotherapist.  Several types of communications and the consent they require are discussed below.</p>     <p>     </p><ol type=\"1\">         <li>Generally, information about your treatment can be released to others only if you sign a written Release of Information form.</li>         <li>There are other situations, however, that require only that you provide written, advance consent.  Your signature on this Agreement provides consent for the following:             <ul type=\"i\">                 <li>Your psychiatrist may occasionally find it helpful to consult other health and mental health professionals about a case. During a consultation, every effort is made to avoid revealing your identity.  The other professionals are also legally bound to keep the information confidential.  You will not be told about these consultations unless your therapist feels it is important to your work together</li>                 <li>Savant Care employs other mental health professionals and administrative staff to run the practice.  As a result, some protected information may be shared with these individuals for both clinical and administrative purposes, such as scheduling, billing, and quality assurance.  All of the mental health professionals and staff are bound by the same rules of confidentiality and all staff members have undergone the appropriate HIPPA training to protect your privacy.  No staff member will release any information outside of the practice without the permission of a professional staff member.</li>                 <li>Savant Care has contracts with other vendors such as software providers and an accountant.  Typically no protected health information is shared with them. As required by HIPAA laws, we have a formal business associate contract with these outside businesses, in which they promise to maintain the confidentiality of any such data except as specifically allowed in the contract or otherwise required by law.</li>                 <li>Disclosures required by health insurers or to collect overdue fees are discussed in the Financial Policies.</li>                 <li>If your psychiatrist believes that you present an imminent danger to your health or safety, he/she may be obligated to seek hospitalization for you or to contact family members or others who can help provide assistance.</li>             </ul>         </li>         <li>There are also some situations where psychiatrists are permitted or required to disclose information without either your consent or authorization:             <ul type=\"i\">                 <li>If you are involved in a court proceeding and a request is made for information concerning the professional services provided to you, such information is protected by the psychiatrist-patient privilege law.

Once such a report is filed, additional information may be required.</li>                 <li>If there is reasons to believe that a client present imminent danger to the health and safety of another, we may be required to disclose information in order to take protective actions, including initiating hospitalization, warning the potential victim, if identifiable and or calling the police.</li>             </ul>         </li>     </ol>     <p></p>     <p>The laws governing confidentiality can be quite complex.

In some cases, formal legal advice may be needed. </p>     <p>Of note, email communication can be relatively easily accessed by unauthorized people, and thus, the privacy and confidentiality of such communication can be easily compromised.

This session is also an opportunity for both you and the provider to assess your mutual compatibility for an ongoing treatment relationship.  Depending on the complexity of your case, the initial evaluation may exceed 75 minutes, in which case a second 45-minute appointment will be made to complete the assessment and make treatment recommendations. Medications may or may not be prescribed during the initial appointment(s). An initial consult with a provider is not the establishment of a provider-patient relationship.&nbsp;</p>     <p><strong>Privacy:</strong> Savant Care will not disclose details of your treatment nor your medical record to third parties without your written approval.  I work in accordance with the HIPPA laws.  You understand your rights under the HIPPA laws, can discuss these with me at anytime and have received notice of privacy policies.</p>     <p><strong>Payment:</strong> Credit card information or bank information will be obtained prior to your first appointment at Savant Care. You or your payer will be charged at the beginning of each clinic appointment, home visit and/or in-hospital visit with your Savant Care provider according to the fee structure outlined in the financial policies. If you have insurance, then we will charge the appropriate amount. If you seek reimbursement from an insurer, Savant Care can submit claims on your behalf at your request (see financial policies for further information).&nbsp;</p>     <p><strong>Late, Missed Appointment and Cancellation Policies:</strong>  Sessions start on time and end on time. If you arrive too late to allow time for proper care, you may be asked to reschedule.  If you are more than 15 minutes late to your appointment, you will be asked to reschedule.  Missed appointments prevent you from receiving required care and prevent the doctor from providing that care.  They also prevent another person from care during that time.  As a result, <strong>you will be financially responsible for the full session fee if you miss your appointment or fail to cancel your appointment within at least 3 business days of the appointment.</strong>  If an appointment must be missed for whatever reason, <strong>you have the option of rescheduling your appointment within the same week of the missed appointment depending on the doctor\'s availability; in this scenario, you will not be charged for a missed appointment.</strong> </p>     <p><strong>Disclosures:</strong> If you are a danger to yourself or others or if I suspect abuse towards a child, disabled adult or the elderly, I am ethically and legally required to report it to the appropriate authorities.</p>     <p><strong>Legal Issues:</strong> In order to safeguard the process of treatment, our providers do not testify in court. I do not accept gifts from patients nor participate in business deals with patients. </p><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Controlled substance policy:</span>&nbsp;Please take extra precaution when handling a prescription of controlled substances (as per DEA, definition of a controlled substance) such as Opiates, Stimulants, Sedative-Hypnotic agents etc. we reserve the rights to refuse giving early refills or to replace lost prescriptions.

You should be aware that, in order for you to obtain reimbursement, your insurance company requires a clinical diagnosis and information about the services provided to you. Sometimes, your physician must provide additional clinical information such as treatment plans or summaries, or copies of your entire Clinical Record. In such situations, every effort will be made to release only the minimum information about you that is necessary for the purpose requested. This information will become part of the insurance company\'s records. Though all insurance companies claim to keep such information confidential, we have no control over what they do with it once it is in their hands.</p><p><strong>Cancellation Policies: </strong>Sessions start on time and end on time. If you arrive too late to allow time for proper care, you may be asked to reschedule. If you are more than 15 minutes late to your appointment, you will be asked to reschedule. Missed appointments prevent you from receiving required care and prevent the doctor from providing that care. It also prevents another person from receiving care during that time. As a result,&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">you will be financially responsible for $250 cancellation fee if you miss your initial appointment&nbsp;or fail to cancel it within at least 3 business days of the appointment.

In this scenario, you will not be charged for a missed appointment. If you fail to make your rescheduled appointment, you will be billed the cancellation fees for BOTH sessions missed.

However, prior to posting any negative reviews or comments on any forums, websites, and/or public databases, you are obligated to contact our office at cofounders@savantcare.com to voice any concerns or issues you are facing. An internal review of the situation will be conducted and the items reported will be addressed within fifteen (15) business days. If you disagree with Savant Care\'s internal findings, you may request an arbitration of the matter pursuant to the arbitration clause below.&nbsp;<br></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Arbitration: </span>At Savant Care, we treat mental health patients with anxiety, depression, psychosis, delusion, and schizophrenia. Our Psychiatrists have to take a very hard stance against patients to call out the alternate realities. This causes cognitive dissonance and makes the mental health patient react in unpredictable manners such as violence or bullying. Our psychiatrists take precautions against violence through very strong privacy measures in which patients can not reach the psychiatrist outside of the mental health clinic. This arbitration clause has been put in place to protect our psychiatrist against online bullying behavior. At Savant Care, we consider anti-bullying measures to be very critical to treatment because the relationship between a Psychiatrist and Patient is the treatment tool.</p><p class=\"p2\">At Savant Care, our psychiatrists will not treat a patient who does not agree to anti-online bullying measures.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p2\">By agreeing to be seen by a Psychiatrist at Savant Care, you agree to be bound to arbitration of any dissatisfaction with interactions. Arbitration will be conducted by an independently appointed Arbiter in accordance with local rules of Arbitration, and any findings shall be legally binding. Arbitration will occur within 50 miles of the mental health clinic that the mental health patient was treated.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p2\">Before the arbitration results are finalized, the patient agrees not to post any reviews online.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p2\">If a negative review has been posted, the patient agrees and authorizes Savant Care to reach out to the website and ask for the removal.</p><p class=\"p2\">Failure to proceed with Arbitration before posting inflammatory, demeaning, or unproven accusation against the organization, providers, and/or employees will be considered a breach of the mental health treatment contract.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p2\">The mental health patient agree to be liable to a charge of $250/day from the date of initially posting such bullying materials. These funds will be donated by Savant Care to Anti-Bullying and Mental Health Non-Profits.<br></p><p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Online Reviews and Social Media Policy:</span>&nbsp;We respect the rights of individuals to express themselves on forums, social media, or other public domains.

Sometimes, your physician must provide additional clinical information such as treatment plans or summaries, or copies of your entire Clinical Record. In such situations, every effort will be made to release only the minimum information about you that is necessary for the purpose requested.

In such situations, every effort will be made to release only the minimum information about you that is necessary for the purpose requested.

Allowing to reschedule is a courtesy service we provide because we understand sometimes last minute events happen.

You should be aware that, in order for you to obtain reimbursement, your insurance company requires a clinical diagnosis and information about the services provided to you. Sometimes, your physician must provide additional clinical information such as treatment plans or summaries, or copies of your entire Clinical Record. In such situations, every effort will be made to release only the minimum information about you that is necessary for the purpose requested. This information will become part of the insurance company\'s records. Though all insurance companies claim to keep such information confidential, we have no control over what they do with it once it is in their hands.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:16pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">C.

There are sometimes exceptions to coverage - If you are a member of an insurance plan and are interested in utilizing your coverage for mental health treatment, it is very important that you find out exactly what mental health services your particular policy covers. You should carefully read the section in your insurance coverage booklet that describes mental health services. &nbsp;If you have questions about the coverage, call your plan administrator. &nbsp;Our &nbsp;staff will provide you with assistance in receiving the benefits to which you are entitled; however you (not your insurance company) are responsible for full payment of your bill in the event insurance does not pay for any reason. &nbsp;If your failure to comply with your insurance company’s requirements regarding choice of providers, authorization, or other issues resulting in the denial of claims, you will be responsible for paying in full. &nbsp;If your coverage changes, it is your responsibility to notify your provider and to comply with your new policy. &nbsp;In-Network participation by SC and its providers are subject to change without notice. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:16pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Once Savant Care has all of the information about your insurance coverage, your psychiatrist will discuss what you can expect to accomplish with the benefits that are available and what will happen if they run out before you feel ready to end your treatment. &nbsp;It is important to remember that you always have the right to pay for services out of pocket to avoid the potential issues described above (unless this is prohibited by your insurance contract). </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:16pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">You should be aware that your insurance company requires a clinical diagnosis and information about the services provided to you. &nbsp;Sometimes, your physician must provide additional clinical information such as treatment plans or summaries, or copies of your entire clinical record. &nbsp;In such situations, every effort will be made to release only the minimum information about you that is necessary for the purpose requested. &nbsp;This information will become part of the insurance company’s records. Though all insurance companies claim to keep such information confidential, we have no control over what they do with it once it is in their hands. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:16pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">It is our policy to charge on a prorated basis for other professional services such as extended telephone consultations, report writing, meeting attendance, disability or other paperwork, letter writing and preparation of treatment summaries.

may only partially cover our fees; contact your insurer for details on your out-of-network coverage. You should be aware that, in order for you to obtain reimbursement, your insurance company requires a clinical diagnosis and information about the services provided to you. Sometimes, your physician must provide additional clinical information such as treatment plans or summaries, or copies of your entire Clinical Record. In such situations, every effort will be made to release only the minimum information about you that is necessary for the purpose requested. This information will become part of the insurance company\'s records. Though all insurance companies claim to keep such information confidential, we have no control over what they do with it once it is in their hands.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:16pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">C.

may only partially cover our fees; contact your insurer for details on your out-of-network coverage. You should be aware that, in order for you to obtain reimbursement, your insurance company requires a clinical diagnosis and information about the services provided to you. Sometimes, your physician must provide additional clinical information such as treatment plans or summaries, or copies of your entire Clinical Record. In such situations, every effort will be made to release only the minimum information about you that is necessary for the purpose requested. This information will become part of the insurance company\'s records. Though all insurance companies claim to keep such information confidential, we have no control over what they do with it once it is in their hands.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:16pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">C.

There are sometimes exceptions to coverage. Each insurance plan has different benefits for you as well as different financial obligations. Not all insurance policies cover all services and/or manners of providing services such as telepsychiatry. If you are a member of an insurance plan and are interested in utilizing your coverage for mental health treatment, it is very important that you find out exactly what mental health services your particular policy covers. It is ultimately your responsibility to check with your insurance company to determine covered benefits. Before you engage SC for telepsychiatry services, it is especially important to confirm that telepsychiatry sessions are covered by your particular plan as some plans cover psychiatry in general but do not cover telepsychiatry. You should carefully read the section in your insurance coverage booklet that describes mental health services. &nbsp;If you have questions about the coverage, call your plan administrator. &nbsp;Our &nbsp;staff will provide you with assistance in receiving the benefits to which you are entitled; however you (not your insurance company) are responsible for full payment of your bill in the event insurance does not pay for any reason. &nbsp;If your coverage changes, it is your responsibility to notify your provider and to comply with your new policy. &nbsp;In-Network participation by SC and its providers are subject to change without notice. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:16pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Once Savant Care has all of the information about your insurance coverage, your psychiatrist will discuss what you can expect to accomplish with the benefits that are available and what will happen if they run out before you feel ready to end your treatment. &nbsp;It is important to remember that you always have the right to pay for services out of pocket to avoid the potential issues described above (unless this is prohibited by your insurance contract). </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:16pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">You should be aware that your insurance company requires a clinical diagnosis and information about the services provided to you. &nbsp;Sometimes, your physician must provide additional clinical information such as treatment plans or summaries, or copies of your entire clinical record. &nbsp;In such situations, every effort will be made to release only the minimum information about you that is necessary for the purpose requested. &nbsp;This information will become part of the insurance company’s records. Though all insurance companies claim to keep such information confidential, we have no control over what they do with it once it is in their hands. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:16pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">It is our policy to charge on a prorated basis for other professional services such as extended telephone consultations, report writing, meeting attendance, disability or other paperwork, letter writing and preparation of treatment summaries.

may only partially cover our fees; contact your insurer for details on your out-of-network coverage. You should be aware that, in order for you to obtain reimbursement, your insurance company requires a clinical diagnosis and information about the services provided to you. Sometimes, your physician must provide additional clinical information such as treatment plans or summaries, or copies of your entire Clinical Record. In such situations, every effort will be made to release only the minimum information about you that is necessary for the purpose requested. This information will become part of the insurance company\'s records. Though all insurance companies claim to keep such information confidential, we have no control over what they do with it once it is in their hands.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:16pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">C.

There are sometimes exceptions to coverage. Each insurance plan has different benefits for you as well as different financial obligations. Not all insurance policies cover all services and/or manners of providing services such as telepsychiatry. If you are a member of an insurance plan and are interested in utilizing your coverage for mental health treatment, it is very important that you find out exactly what mental health services your particular policy covers. It is ultimately your responsibility to check with your insurance company to determine covered benefits. Before you engage SC for telepsychiatry services, it is especially important to confirm that telepsychiatry sessions are covered by your particular plan as some plans cover psychiatry in general but do not cover telepsychiatry. You should carefully read the section in your insurance coverage booklet that describes mental health services. &nbsp;If you have questions about the coverage, call your plan administrator. &nbsp;Our &nbsp;staff will provide you with assistance in receiving the benefits to which you are entitled; however you (not your insurance company) are responsible for full payment of your bill in the event insurance does not pay for any reason. &nbsp;If your coverage changes, it is your responsibility to notify your provider and to comply with your new policy. &nbsp;In-Network participation by SC and its providers are subject to change without notice. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:16pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Once Savant Care has all of the information about your insurance coverage, your psychiatrist will discuss what you can expect to accomplish with the benefits that are available and what will happen if they run out before you feel ready to end your treatment. &nbsp;It is important to remember that you always have the right to pay for services out of pocket to avoid the potential issues described above (unless this is prohibited by your insurance contract). </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:16pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">You should be aware that your insurance company requires a clinical diagnosis and information about the services provided to you. &nbsp;Sometimes, your physician must provide additional clinical information such as treatment plans or summaries, or copies of your entire clinical record. &nbsp;In such situations, every effort will be made to release only the minimum information about you that is necessary for the purpose requested. &nbsp;This information will become part of the insurance company’s records. Though all insurance companies claim to keep such information confidential, we have no control over what they do with it once it is in their hands. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:16pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">It is our policy to charge on a prorated basis for other professional services such as extended telephone consultations, report writing, meeting attendance, disability or other paperwork, letter writing and preparation of treatment summaries.

may only partially cover our fees; contact your insurer for details on your out-of-network coverage. You should be aware that, in order for you to obtain reimbursement, your insurance company requires a clinical diagnosis and information about the services provided to you. Sometimes, your physician must provide additional clinical information such as treatment plans or summaries, or copies of your entire Clinical Record. In such situations, every effort will be made to release only the minimum information about you that is necessary for the purpose requested. This information will become part of the insurance company\'s records. Though all insurance companies claim to keep such information confidential, we have no control over what they do with it once it is in their hands.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:16pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">C.

Psychiatrists are medical doctors that have extensive medical and psychological training that equip them to see the big picture of what treatments will best fit your needs.

Your psychiatrist will collaborate regularly with and provide supervision to your therapist about your case to make sure the treatment continues according to plan so that you meet your mental health goals.</span></li></ol><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"></span><br></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Patient Responsibilities:</b></span></p><ol class=\"p1\"><li> <span class=\"s1\">I understand that since my psychotherapy is being supervised by my psychiatrist, I can request my psychiatrist to be present during the therapy session or my therapist can request my psychiatrist to be present.</span></li><li> <span class=\"s1\">I understand that Savant Care will bill my insurance company for therapy appointments co-signed by my psychiatrist.</span></li><li> <span class=\"s1\">Once I have met my treatment goals, my psychiatrist may discontinue my psychotherapy.</span></li><li> <span class=\"s1\">If I do not feel the need to see a Savant Care psychiatrist, I will discuss this with my treatment team and look for a therapist outside Savant Care.</span></li><li> <span class=\"s1\">I understand that I need to meet with my psychiatrist at least once every 6 months to make sure my treatment goals are being met.</span></li></ol><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"></span><br></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Savant Care Responsibilities:</b></span></p><ol class=\"p1\"><li> <span class=\"s1\">Once I have completed my treatment and do not need to see a psychiatrist, I will smoothly transition to an outside therapist over a reasonable timeline that will be set by my therapist. </span></li><li> <span class=\"s1\">If my psychiatrist stops working at Savant Care for any reason, I will be matched with another psychiatrist at Savant Care.
