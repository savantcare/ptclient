INSERT INTO `siteWideHelpMaster` VALUES (1,4181,'Q) What can you do with the EMR customizer?\n\n\nQ) Why is the EMR customizer transparent?\n1. Since the design box is controlling the information below it people will get immediate feedback.\n2. If the information below was unrelated it would have lead to cognitive overload but since the information is the one directly being controlled it leads to immediate feedback instead of cognitive overload.','2016-01-07 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),(2,11,'Q) What can you do here?\n1. Add care team members for a patient.\n2. Add doctor\'s team as a care team members for a patient.\n\nQ) How to do it?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu22X3LK6Tw\n\nQ) Why was this developed?\n1. We want the patients to know the individuals who are responsible for their care. This way they can reach out to the correct person at SC. For this reason the care team members for a patient are viewable from the patient portal.\n2. Patient privacy is important. This feature allows us to restrict the patient file to a sub group of users of EMR.Only care team members can access the patient file.In case of a doctor\'s team all members of a doctor\'s team can access the patient file.\n\nQ) In care team instead of assigning individuals Why are we allowing to assign teams?\n1. When a doctor is on leave I cannot go inside 200 patients and assign a backup Dr.\n2. Say both Vs and SP are on leave than a 3rd doctor can be added to the team instead of adding to 200 patients.','2016-01-11 00:00:00','2016-01-18 00:00:00'),(3,11,'Q) What can you do here?\n1.

The numbers represent the following:\n\n0 = good\n0.5 = no insight\n1 = poor\n\nQ) How does the ROS system work?\n\n1. Old values are carried forward for each of 17 sub topics. This carry forward is only for display.\n\n2. For a particular subtopic to mark it as reviewed you can do one of 2 things:\nA. Change at least one value. This includes re selecting the same value.\nor,\nB. Click on refresh icon beside the subtopic name. \n\n3. You can click on \"Finalize the report\" icon for \"ROS\" only if at least one subtopic has been reviewed. \"Finalize the report\" icon is denoted by a check mark and it appears to the right of the panel name \"Review of systems\".  \n\n4. When the appointment note is generated for ROS section of the appointment note will contain the subtopics which have been reviewed. Beside each sub topic it will show the last reviewed on date. For e.g. if D sees a patient on 1st Jan and reviews Anxiety and Depression. On 1st feb appointment D reviews Anxiety. Than in the appointment note for 1st feb it will show Anxiety Last reviewed on 1st feb and Depression Last reviewed on 1st Jan.\n\n5. The history icon beside \"ROS\" in the panel header will pull up the history for ROS reports. \n\n6. The graph icon beside the sub topic name will show the graph for only that subtopic.\n\n7. When D is looking at any of the 17 subtopics beside the sub topic name we show \"Last reviewed on: Date\"\nFor e.g. Social anxiety has 5 questions each of the 5 questions can have a different updated_on date. But they will have the same created_on date. In the last reviewed on we show the latest updated_on date.\nReason: When the 2nd Q is answered it is assumed that D reviewed all the 5 Q.\n\nQ) Out of the 17 sub topics which are shown in open state?\nThose subtopics that have been used previously show up in open state. Those sub topics which have never been used show up in closed state.\nWhy?\nNot every patient will have each of the 17 sub topics reviewed for them. By deciding in program which sub topic to show as open we are customizing the system for each patient.\n\nQ) How are the subtopics ordered?\nThe sub topic that has been used by the doctor most recently is shown at the top.\nWhy?\nThe doctor is most likely to review this sub topic again.\n\nQ) Why is there \"Refresh the review date\" icon beside each sub topic?\nSay the D is looking at gateway mood symptoms and is seeing the ratings that D had done previously. D mentally has reviewed the \"Gateway mood symptoms\" but the system has no way to know that. System can know that \"Gateway mood symptoms\" have been reviewed only if D clicks on \"Refresh the review date\"\n\nQ) What is the significance of the yellow background?\nSomething in this subtopic has been modified and now the ROS report can be finalized.\n\nQ) What are some of the design principles?\nAmbience intelligence: The tooltips show the graph to provide ambience intelligence to the Doctors.','2016-01-13 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),(5,11,'(Q) How to add Emergency Contacts?','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),(6,6948,'\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scC4_fLujmA \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBjQtgv5OLo','2016-01-18 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),(7,440,'<a target=anatomy href=https://www.savantcare.com/internal-discourse/t/q7-what-is-the-anatomy-of-sc-calendar/30/1>Q) What is the anatomy of SC calendar?\r\n</a><a target=spanner href=https://www.savantcare.com/internal-discourse/t/q8-how-to-use-the-calendar-spanner/31/1>Q) How to use calendar spanner?</a> \r\n<a target=afa href=https://www.savantcare.com/internal-discourse/t/q9-how-to-set-the-times-you-are-available-for-appointment/32/1>Q) How to set the times you are available for appointment?</a>','2016-01-19 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),(8,11312,'Q) What happens when a event or a note is locked?\n1.Appointments once locked cannot be deleted.\n2.It is possible to change the duration and status of the locked appointment.\n3.Once note has been locked than the duration and status are also locked.\n\nQ) When is an event considered a conflict?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system will show the host is busy and cannot be added to an appointment or conference if:\n1.
