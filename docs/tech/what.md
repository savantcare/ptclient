### Common between layer 1 and layer 2

**Local State (267 loc)** -> [/store/modules/recommendation.js](https://github.com/savantcare/patientfile/blob/master/vue-client/src/store/modules/recommendation.js) -> State of this component. Functions to mutate state. Socket functions to change state.

## Q7) How to do discontinue and delete in temporal DB? 

1. When doctor says change then run a edit query

2. When doctor says discontinue then run a delete query

### What is the DB doing internally?

1. For each record a start and end time is maintained. These 2 columns are hidden from the sql query.

2. So when a edit is done mysql is internally adding a new record. And marking the end time of the previous record.

3. When a delete is done mysql is NOT deleting from the DB. Mysql is just marking the end time of that record.

## Q8) How the system decides which components are allowed access for each user role? Also what is the initial load sequence?
sc_user Â»Table: user_roles has the following fields:
componentsAllowedToAccess
multiStateDisplayAreaAreaComponentLoadSequence
currentStateDisplayAreaAreaComponentLoadSequence

The data looks like this:
| id                                   | name                   | componentsAllowedToAccess | multiStateDisplayAreaAreaComponentLoadSequence | currentStateDisplayAreaAreaComponentLoadSequence |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 897d25c6-2c84-47fe-9236-2c3cc9c70bdf | Doctor                 | Rex,Rem,Shx               | Rex,Rem,Shx                                    | Rem,Rex                                          |
